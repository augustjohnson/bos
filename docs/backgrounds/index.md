# Backgrounds

## Emancipated Clone
You were born as a clone, likely of someone quite wealthy. You may have been created for spare parts, or for some other devious purpose. You genetically ARE them, but you have petitioned for your independence, or been freed.  You are now considered distinct from them in every way except for your body, appearance, and genetics.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Two of your choice.
**Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice.
**Equpment:** Documents proving your status as a freed cloned.

**Feature: Impersonation**
In many ways, you ARE the person you were cloned to be.  You can pass for this person at a glance, or even biologically.  This offers certain benefits such as convincing bouncers at clubs that you are famous, often granting entry to exclusive places otherwise unavailable to poor commoners.

## Custom Background
You can make your own custom background in this universe.  You must describe how you got this background, but the following constraints apply:

 * Proficiency in two skills.
 * Proficiency in one or optionally two tools.
 * Optional proficiency in a language.*
* A package of keepsakes from home.
