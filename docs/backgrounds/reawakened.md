{% include breadcrumbs.html %}

You've been in cryogenic stasis for decades or even over a century. You may have entered stasis for various reasons, voluntarily, because of a terrible accident, or because of terrible disease. Before going under, you set a condition for your reawakening. That condition has been met.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, and one of your choice.

**Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice that existed when you entered stasis.

**Equipment:** A horribly outdated piece of technology that still serves its purpose well enough for you to use it.

**Feature: Good Ol' Days** There are a few reawakened throughout the system, and they like to reminisce about old times.  You and your companions can expect to recieve assistance and accomodations from other reawakened individuals, as long as it is not against their interests.
