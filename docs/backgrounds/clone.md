{% include breadcrumbs.html %}

You were born as a clone, likely of someone quite wealthy. You may have been created for spare parts, or for some other devious purpose. You genetically ARE them, but you have petitioned for your independence, or been freed.  You are now considered distinct from them in every way except for your body, appearance, and genetics.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Two of your choice.

**Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice.

**Equipment:** Documents proving your status as a freed clone.

**Feature: Impersonation**  In many ways, you ARE the person you were cloned to be.  You can pass for this person at a glance, or even biologically.  This offers certain benefits, often granting entry to exclusive places otherwise unavailable to poor commoners.
