Aristocrats have access to treatments and technologies from birth that are unobtainable by the general public.  This allow for significant deviations from normal human development.
## Aristocrat Traits
Your aristocrat character has 

### Age
Although aristocrats reach physical maturity at about the same age as standard humans, they have so far shown few signs of aging at the current maximum age of 200 years old, due to genetic and advanced medical treatments.  While this requires occasional expensive medical work, an aristocrat has many traits that were given to them early in life.

### Darkvision
You were given treatment to upgrade your eyes, and can see dim light within 60 feet as it if were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Keen Senses
You were given treatment to upgrade their ears as well.  You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

### Hardened Interfaces (Fey Ancestry)
You have advantage on saving throws against being "charm hacked", and hacks cannot force you to go unconcious.

### Trance
Aristocrats don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a standard human does from 8 hours of sleep.

### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common.

## Subraces

### High Society (High Elf)

### Weapon Training
You have proficiency with rapiers and beam rifles.

### Cantrip

* Encode Thoughts
* Friends
* Gust
* Mage Hand
* Mind Sliver
* Minor Illusion (the images you make need to be mostly predetermined)
