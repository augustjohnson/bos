The voidborn have spent most of their life, including their childhood in low-gravity environments. In addition, many of the voidborn have undergone specific genetic treatments to keep their bodies small and efficient. This allow for significant deviations from normal human development.

Life is hard for the voidborn, and while medicine has advanced incredibly since humanity's journey off of earth, there are many dangers in space.  The life expectancy of a voidborn is 50 years, although that's improving with medical and safety advances.

### Darkvision
You were given treatment to upgrade your eyes, and can see dim light within 60 feet as it if were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Size
Voidborn can vary greatly in size from 3ft fully grown (due to careful genetic deamplification in utero) to 8ft tall (due to the lack of gravity on a normal human growth cycle).  None are muscular or bulky due to the lack of gravity in their normal environment.  Very few would weigh more than 100lbs in earth gravity.  You can choose to be Small or Medium size.

### Gear Nerd

### Tinker
You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 100 kilobucks worth of materials to construct a Tiny robotic device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

_Clockwork Toy._ This toy is simple tracked robot. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes can play back a pre-recorded message or make beeping noises.

_Fire Starter._ The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

_Music Box._ When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.
