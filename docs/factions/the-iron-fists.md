# The Iron Fists
The Iron Fists are a human faction (although a few half-orcs can be found among them), that absolutely hate magic in any form.  They arrest and detain any outward magic user, or kill anyone that uses magic against them.  They are a militant theocracy, with a huge standing army of well trained soldiers.  They are highly mistrustful of races that have inherent magic (elves, gnomes, genasi).  They do not spread their doctrine beyond their borders, and are rarely outwardly hostile.

## Roles within the Iron Fists
* **Reclaimer** - Responsible for protection of Valmest, and the enforcement of it's laws.
* **High Reclaimer** - Responsible for the direction of the Iron Fists. Usually reclusive, and by tradition speaks almost exclusively with the Reclaimer.
