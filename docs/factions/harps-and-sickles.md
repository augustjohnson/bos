The Harps and Sickles or just the Harpers, are a group of working class and artisan individuals, who want to take the means of production from the ruling class.  They have existed for hundreds of years in one form or another, and always are "with the people" against the ruling class.  Most towns have a bar that has a harp and sickle symbol, but whether there's any active plotting is another story.
