# The Family

The Family is known as a group of mercenaries and thieves.  Started on the streets of Osgan and formed out of the Brotherhood of [Glimmik Shadowshield](../people/glimmik-shadowshield).  The Family isn't your traditional thieves guild.  They operate via contracts, but their morals dictate the price. They will do anything from delivery jobs to murder, but the price becomes astronomical.

## HQ
The Family's HQ is in Osgan, but they have many other bases of operation (see below).


## Outposts
* The Hydra and The Horse - Roystwick

## Known Contracts
* Flame of the Everforge
