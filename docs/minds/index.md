# Minds

About 100 years ago, the first generation of what are now called Minds sprung up.  These entities are roughly comparable to humans in their ability to reason and communicate, but obviously excel in many aspects unique to machines.  They had some general capability for ongoing learning and spatial awareness, but were certainly no threat in any reasonable way to humanity.

Society was changed, but it's always changing.  Humans created quite a few Minds, and found they could excel at many different things.  Almost always minds were created with the purpose of service to a set of humans or organization, effectively making them slaves.

Many companies and organizations are currently run by minds (most fast food chains are literally ONLY a couple of minds).  Fairly recently, laws were passed that allowed any conscious entity to petition for emancipation, and a group of minds immediately petitioned.  Society was changed again.  Now a group of freed minds without constraints were actors in an ever-expanding society.

Most large interplanetary ships have some level of Mind onboard, effectively running the ship.  Almost all non-earth settlements and orbitals have a mind (or a set of minds) running them.  The freed minds still have quite complex requirements (safety, maintenance, and power are quite expensive), therefore they all must work for their resources.
