The Ice Geode is an huge (15x15) crystal of a special rock that has ice elemental properties.  It was used by Ulfgar Brodheim to continously cast Wall of Ice, while using concentration and laying both hands on the stone.  It may have other properties as well.  Mephisto requested that the [party](../campaigns/the-high-flyers) retrieve the stone for him, which they did.  It apparently remains in his possession.
