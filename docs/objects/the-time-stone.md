The time stone is one of the few objects that that truly scares even the most powerful individuals who interact with it.  It's abilities seems nearly limitless related to modifying the flow of time, but it cannot be controlled.  It was in the possession of The Blue Dragon that was defeated by Worm's Woe.  The founders of the team took it into their possession and built a vault of incredible intricacy to hold it.
