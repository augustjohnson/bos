## Communication
We all use the [DNDKC slack](https://dndkc.slack.com) for all messaging and communication.  

## Scheduling
West Marches Scheduling.  Those rules are, the players initiate everything.  There are not any regularly scheduled games, and the DM is **not** responsible for anything except coming up an entertaining scenario to play (which is a buttload of work).  The following conditions apply though.

1. A willing DM has to be available that time/date.
2. A preferred location (i.e. remote, hybrid, August's Basement.)
3. The players have to tell the DM where they intend to take their player characters with at least 2 weeks of notice.  Potentially less if it's a Quest.

This should result in some extremely flexible situations, meaning, if you literally don't live in the same country as the rest of your party and still want to kidnap some bullywugs, we can make that work (in fact we have!)

## Quests
The players can respond to quests on the [Worm's Woe Quest Board](../quest-board), or they can simply explore [the world.](../places/the-world), by picking a place, or even suggesting a broad scenario (i.e. let's hunt some Orcs!).

## Players
This is a list of people who have signed up to be part of this group.

Name | Role | Player Character | Current Quest
--- | --- | --- | ---
August | DM, Player | ? | ?

## Player Characters
Your player characters are fixed at level 1 to start, as of 2019-01-01, and you may only have one player character.  Eventually this will sync up (for example, everyone will have their PCs be at Level 5 by July 1)

## Continuity
Each individual quest will happen inside of it's own continuity bubble, or will include coordination between dungeon masters.  Occasionally, multiple groups will sync up and large events will give everyone a point of reference.
