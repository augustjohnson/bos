## Scheduling
West Marches Scheduling.  Those rules are, the players initiate everything.  There are not any regularly scheduled games, and the DM is not responsible for anything except coming up with a universe to play in (which is a buttload of work).  The players can respond to quests on the [Worm's Woe Quest Board](../quest-board), or they can simply explore [the world.](../places/the-world).  The following conditions apply though.

1. A willing DM has to be available that time/date.
2. The players have to tell the DM where they intend to go with at least 2 weeks of notice.  Potentially less if it's a Quest.
