# An Academic Inquiry into the Timekeepers of Khorkizar
> - Reynald Brustica, Senior Apprentice at the Collegium of Religion, University of Roystwick

The Timekeepers of Khorkizar are a fabled group, often dismissed as legend to those who have not seen their handiwork.  In this document, I choose to offer concrete proof of their existence and to explore their impact on the greater world.  I do not offer conclusive proof of who they are but I believe I can definitively show what they do, and I offer some theories on how they do it.

First, an explanation for those who are unfamiliar with the phenomenon.

Khorkizar is a port town, on the mouth of a river, in a bay on the southern portion of the eastern continent.  The river is called the "Booble" by the locals, but many maps have it labeled as the "Alorivna." It is not large.  The river flows south into the bay.  On the eastern side, the town of Khorkizar is laid out along the bay and the mouth of the river.  Most trade is done by boat, and the town layout clearly shows that. During my studies I stayed in a working class neighborhood, mostly stevedores and longshoremen.  

Immediately up the river from Khorkizar town on the same side of the river, there is a small farming area, a few acres, and then jutting nearly vertical, there is an enormous butte, with very hard rock walls.  The face of the butte (called Timekeeper's Tower) is extremely flat, and faces directly, precisely south. In the center of Khorkizar town there is a plaza that is older than the town itself called "Viewing Plaza".  It's history has been lost, but it has long been thought to be connected to the structures in Timekeeper's Tower, and I believe I have proven that it was almost surely constructed by them. There are a few shapes visible on the face of the butte.  They are organized as a single, extremely large circle (the Earth Dial), and below, two equal circular dials.  (The Planet and Planes dials).

## The Earth Dial
This dial is clearly set up to describe the motion of the Earth, Moon and our position relative to the Sun.  It does so with shocking accuracy.

**Outer Circular Dial - "Clock Dial"**  (or more specifically, rotation of our planet relative to the sun).
This shape is by far the largest dial.  It is difficult to estimate size, but my airship could have comfortable flown through the dial had it been an opening.  It marks the position of the sun relative to the planet, and with a little practice reading it, it offers up the time of day.  It is incredibly accurate.  With my surveyor's tools from the center of Viewing Plaza, I actually used it (and the position of the sun) to identify a minuscule flaw in my observation tools.  The manufacturer acknowledged the defect and gave me a new set of tools. This showed with an incredible amount of precision how accurate the outer dial was.

The Clock dial has two markings on it, Midnight and Noon.  At Midnight each night, the bottom of the dial expels water, through a opening in the face. It is a measured, calculable amount, always the same, and always at the stroke of midnight.  This water is used by the farmers in the fields below the butte to water their fields.  

**Inner Circular Dial - "Year Dial"** (position of our planet relative to the universe at large).
This dial is immediately inside the Time dial, and in certain occasions, can alter the appearance of it.  For example, in winter, when the sun is lower in the sky, the Year Dial covers part of the Clock Dial.  This percentage of coverage corresponds with the lack of daylight, and as a result, the Clock Dial is modified with exact sunrise and sunset throughout the seasons.  

It has four markings, two for the Winter and Midsummer Solstices, and two for the Harvest and Spring Equinoxes.  Each rotation, during the Harvest Equinox, a very large amount of water is expelled from the dial.

Most of the fields below the butte are cranberries, and each year they use this to flood the fields for harvest.  Often this flood comes at a strange hour, as the exact moment of the equinox is variable throughout the cycle of the sun, but the farmers can usually predict it based on the clock.  It has been this way for hundreds of years.

**Moon Inner and Outer Circular Dials** - The moon (position and rotation of our moon relative to our planet).  This has two markings, zenith and antizenith.  There is actually an inner dial for the moon dial, that appears to modify the cycle of the moon, but it is not clear what it is describing.  The modifications to the moon dial are more subtle than the modifications to the Earth Dial.  But it is possible to use the dials to predict the tides with great accuracy.

Water is released from the outer Moon Dial every 31 days and then a small amount has been rumored to be released every 10 years or so from the Inner Moon Dial, but reports are sporadic, and all reports state that the volume is only detectable by very careful observation.  I was unable to observe this phenomenon during my studies.

## The Planets Dial
This dial significantly smaller than the Earth Dial.  It was just smaller than a single inflated airship bladder.  Many houses would be larger.  It is difficult to accurately read from the Viewing Plaza in Khorkizar, so many of my observations had to be made from the fields below.

There appear to be nine dials within this one, the fourth of which is locked with the "Year Dial" on the other clock.  These dials appear to correspond with the known periods of additional planets in our local system, although it describes four bodies which have never been observed.

One of the most interesting attributes of these dials is that when they release water (usually quite small amounts) the water is tinted.  Orange, or red, occasionally yellow, and it smells of sulfur.  See Appendix B for a partial list of approximate periods, and the released water attributes.  This occasionally has disastrous consequences on the crops below because of the contents of the water.  In recent memory, there were two occasions that a release from this (the water was grayish black) resulted in complete destruction of all crops, related to the period of the seventh planet.  It is now well calculated when the next period will occur.


## The Planes Dial
The Third Dial appears to have clear meaning, but it's complexity is difficult to describe.  There are 13 moving parts, many of which are interlocked gears.  I will describe these gears as the sets that they appear to be part of, from the center out.

1. **The Material, Shadow, and Fey gears.**  The Material Gear is in the center of the Planes dial, and it drives Shadow and Fey, which are darker and lighter than it is.
2. **The Elemental gears.**  Each one of these are made of crystals of their corresponding color, red, blue, green, and white.  They interlock, and appear to be lit from within.  They are visible with the naked eye at night.
3. **The Outer Planes Dial**, corresponding to the Ideal planes of Good, Law, Evil, and Chaos.  These four intertwining dials are driven by those inside of them.
4. **The Energy Planes Dial**, a single dial, half white and half black, corresponding to the positive and negative energies.
5. **The dial of Souls**.  Very thin and gray, this dial pulses with a very weak light, only visible during the new moon phase.

The interlocking of each of these is incredibly complex, but it had been assume to move at a constant rate, similarly to the other clocks.  In my observations I discovered that these are not precisely moving at a constant rate, but appear to move fairly steadily.  These dials have no practical application to the people of Khorkizar, and it is not well known that they even describe the planes (or even what the planes are).

## Maintenance of the Dials
In my investigation into these dials, I attempted to boldly take an airship over the top of the butte.  In doing so, I made some significant discoveries.  It is basically impossible to land on the top of the butte, and air currents rising up the sides push any airborne vehicle up so high they cannot safely drop any altitude without risking crashing.  So I made a total of three passes during my study.

While ballooning above the butte, I noticed a few clear things.  First, the top of the butte is mostly a very large lake.  It must exit  subsurface, and I presume that this is the source of the water that exits below, and must be a source of hydro power for the dials themselves.  Second, I discovered obvious signs of farming above, including various types of nuts, legumes, and seeds that birds are known to like.  Thirdly (and most importantly), I saw a Timekeeper from my balloon.  He was bald, and appeared to be sleeping when my airship crested the top of the butte.  I observed his clothing (robes, brown), and hair (none) before he woke up and scurried off.  It was difficult to tell size or even race at my distance.  In fact, it was unclear if he was even male.

## In Conclusion
I theorize that the dials themselves are clearly related to natural and supernatural phenomenon that can be predicted.  I think that there are a small group of hermits who live a completely self sufficient life on materials grown on the top of the butte.  I also theorize that the lake that takes up most of the surface atop the butte is the source of water for both the power of the Dials, and the water released below.  It is very difficult to directly approach the butte by non-magical means, and the Timekeepers clearly do not want to be interrupted in their work. Their precision is without equal though, and all clocks throughout the world are set based on Khorkizar's time.
