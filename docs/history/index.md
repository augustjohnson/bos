# A Brief History

# Fast, Efficient Interplanetary Travel.
A great leap forward was made in ship propulsion. There are now fusion-powered rockets on many larger ships that are sized to generally maintain a constant accelleration of up to 1G while traveling.  This means the time to and from most destinations is measured in days.

# Minds
A set of entities called [minds](../minds) are actors across the system.  These are machines with at least human-level intelligence. Their ability to interact with the world is really only limited by their resources. Some of free to act as they wish, but many are enslaved by corporations or organizations throughout the system.
