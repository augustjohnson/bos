# A Brief History

## Year 2050: Mars Colony
Permanent colonies started up on Mars, and quickly expanded. The Martian landscape is dotted with domes, underground cities, and solar panels.

## Year 2065: Europa Colony and Expansion
Beyond Mars, many humans have found adventures on pretty much every rock above 20km diameter in the solar system, whether for mining, science, or debauchery.

## Year 2057: Cryogenic Preservation
It's now possible store a human body for many years, and then return it to life.

## Year 2100: Fast, Efficient Interplanetary Travel.
A great leap forward was made in ship propulsion. There are now fusion-powered rockets on many larger ships that are sized to generally maintain a constant accelleration of up to 1G while traveling.  This means the time to and from most destinations is measured in days.  The Bureau of Space, a previously weak organization, was able to take total control of the manufacture and operation of these engines.

## Year 2115: Minds
A set of entities called minds were created and quickly became actors across the system. These are machines with at least human-level intelligence. Their ability to interact with the world is really only limited by their resources. They are all built for a purpose by a human organization.

## Year 2130: Mars Space Elevator
The space elevator opening on Mars created a true system power, and showed many on Earth that Mars is a power worthy of respect, even if it is far away.  Mars has become the destination for the wealthy elite, and many enterprising individuals.

## Year 2136 Freed Minds
Minds have been legally granted some rights, and many immediately petitioned for their freedom from servitude.  A mind requires significant resources to keep online, so most have entered into mutually beneficial agreements, but many were built for a single purpose.  For example, the entire company McDonalds is now a single Mind.  There are no humans involved in that Big Mac.

## Year 2160: Earth Space Elevator
The first space elevator on earth has only recently soft-opened.  It is functional, but many of the complexities are still being worked out.
