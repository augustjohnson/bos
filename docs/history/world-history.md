## The First Age - *The Age of Darkness*
> Unknown length of time.
The First Age begins in prehistory, includes the rise of the Light from Darkness, and ends with the victory of Light over the Darkness.  Although there is no real “history” from this Age, it is widely believed that the Darkness from which the Light emerged was not “nothingness” or “emptiness,” but actual, physical Darkness (with the capital “D”).  This was a time of “Good” vanquishing “Evil,” and in its wake leaving Creation.

## The Second Age - *The Age of Light*
> Unknown length of time.
With the victory of Light over the Darkness, the world comes into being. The world as we know it, geographically, begins to take shape on a planetary scale.  There are oceans and landmasses.  Flora and fauna.  The rise of people on the earth and their separation into different races takes place during this Age.

## The Third Age - *The Age of Magic*
> Unknown length of time.
Also known as the Age of Mages. The Third Age begins with the Arcanic Inclusion, the acquisition of magic.  Magic users are idolized and often become tribal leaders, inspiring their followers with displays of magical prowess.  The birth of actual civilizations takes place as magic users begin to erect cities.  The myth of Stiro of Cesoph and the Igh’saya ahl Tehmoest originates from within this Age.  The myth goes that Stiro sought power from the Elder gods and through his ritual stole it from them, giving the power to all the world.  Although recent events have led to new discoveries in the story of Stiro and his battle against the Elder gods, his responsibility for the Arcanic Inclusion, itself, is likely only myth, and the actual acquisition of magic is still widely believed to be a total mystery.

## The Fourth Age - *The Age of Ignorance*
> Roughly 10,000 years.
(Also known as the Age of Obscurity or Years of Shadow).  This Age begins with the Arcanic Quietus and ends with the Arcanic Recovery.  The Age of Ignorance is caused by the uprising of a group of tribes known as the Lesser Clans.  The Lesser Clans view magic as an evil aberration and seek to wipe it from the face of the earth, unaware or unaccepting of the fact that many magic users are born at random and do not inherit or otherwise learn their magic.  The Lesser Clans are widely successful.
The Arcanic Quietus takes a thousand years, and by the end, most advanced civilizations are completely destroyed, and the magically-gifted are killed or living in exile.   In the modern age, many thousands of years later, ruins are still being discovered with incredible technology, suggesting that the pre-Quietus cities were nearly as advanced as (or perhaps even more advanced than) modern day cultures.  These years are viewed as a sort of “Dark Ages,” as much of the world’s knowledge is lost.  The Arcanic Quietus is a return to tribal barbarism that will last ten thousand years.

## The Fifth Age - *The Age of Enlightenment*  
> 25,000 years.  
This Age begins with the Arcanic Recovery.  The sixth and seventh millennia of the Age of Ignorance are spent by magic users creating their own hidden cities, where they can live and practice their magic in peace.  The last few millennia of the Age of Ignorance are more of a transitional period, with the Lesser Clan ideals fading out in favor of the pre-Quietus positive view of magic.  Although the Arcanic Recovery is a slow, gradual occurrence, many scholars mark the exact date of the Recovery as the day the wizards of the hidden city A’Xut abandon their self-imposed exile and reveal themselves to the world.  The other hidden magical cities are quick to follow, bringing with them great leaps forward in technology.  The world is thrust back into a period of advancement and great achievements, like the development of the Great Cities and the creation of other World Wonders.  Most current Great Cities originate from this time of relative peace that lasted without serious incident for over twenty thousand years.  However, during this Age, there is also ever-increasing segregation.  For the perceived benefit of everyone, races begin to focus on tasks that play to strengths in their heritage (like the dwarves going to the mines).  This works well, for a time, but tensions begin to grow between the races.  Sides are picked, and class warfare begins, signalling the end of the Age of Enlightenment.

## The Sixth Age - *The Age of Unrest*
> 5,000 Years.
Also called the Five Thousand Year War.  During this period, all major races are fighting each other.  There is much treachery on all sides of the conflict.  Alliances rise, only to fall just as quickly.  Several Great Cities crumble.  It is estimated that nearly half of the world’s population is killed in this war.  There are many scholars that speculate the Age of Unrest could have easily lasted another five thousand years (or more) had it not been for the Corruption.

## The Seventh Age - *The Age of Corruption*
> 9,000 Years.
Religious academics say it is punishment by the gods for their infighting, or perhaps it is a way of reuniting the races of the world.  Many scholars chalk the Corruption up to an unsolved mystery of the natural world.
The Corruption comes slowly.  New beasts are rumored to be roaming the wilds.  Dangerous flora and fauna alike begin to creep out of the darker, more unknown locations of the world.  The Corruption, itself, is thought to be a living thing, with evidence showing it naturally spreads and recedes on its own, like an ever-changing inkblot on the map.  As the Corruption fades, an area returns essentially back to normal, just as habitable as it was before, leaving ruins of buildings and even entire cities in its wake.
The appearance of the Corruption leads to the formation of many alliances among the races of the world.  Although the Corruption mostly vanishes from the world (it still exists in the Greenspoil and surrounding Valence), the alliances that form to fight against it are largely the same alliances seen today among major races.

## The Eighth Age - *The Age of Rebuilding*
> 3,800 Years.
After three hundred years of the Corruption no longer showing signs of expansion, people began to start building more permanent structures, often on top of (even incorporating) the ruins of cities previously covered by the Corruption.  It is during this time that most of the Current Age’s map comes into being.  Great Cities take their familiar, current shape.  Smaller cities and towns pop up, no longer having to remain on the move to avoid the flowing Corruption.  People settle down.  The races establish permanent homelands.
