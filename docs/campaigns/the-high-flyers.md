# The High Flyers
This campaign August's first campaign as DM, and started as a one-shot that could potentially progress into a multi-stage campaign.  The first three chapters were played by Chad, Pat, Karl and Matt.  Ea joined in Chapter 4.

## Chapter 1: Trouble at Mount Crignis
The (level 3) group answered an open call for assistance by a wealthy dwarven mine-owner to assist in some issues at his mine, across the bay from [Hatham](../places/hatham).  The mine was being flooded for an unknown reason, stopping work, and endangering some individuals.  The group explored the mine, defeating some Kuo-toa, finding some fire crystals and some ice crystals, as well as (eventually) the source of the flooding.  A dwarven wizard had been focusing an ice-wall spell for days holding back a some magma mephits threatening the mine.  The ice-wall was constantly melting, and that water had flowed down and flooded the mine.  The group defeated the mephits and saved the wizard, [Ulfgar Brodheim](../people/ulfgar-brodheim).

### A cordial chat with Mr. M.
On the way back to the mainland, the team was given a mysterious message.  Shortly after, time stopped, and a doorway to another plane appeared. A powerful being introduced himself as Mephistopheles, and threatened or bought a favor from the team.  Their first task was to gather an enormously powerful stone from inside of the erupting mountain.  For that they recieved information on where Regas Firewind, a fiend on the run from the Iron Fists who had been the bane of Dredge's party was.  He also retrieved one of his agents, a dwarf named Darrak, with seemingly nefarious intent.

## Chapter 2: The Cracked Cathedral
In Hatham, the town showed signs of an explosion of some sort.  The team was brought by [Rolf Spilton](../people/rolf-spilton), a small-time mafioso aligned with the [Harps and Sickles](../factions/harps-and-sickles), which [Breckin](../people/breckin) was familiar with.  He tasked Breckin with a particular task, delivering some chests with unknown contents to contacts among the Harpers.  The urgency was very high, related to an uprising that had just recently be started by more fanatical members of the Harpers.  The team agreed to the task, and were given a cart and sent on their way.  [SevenToes](../people/seventoes), Dredge's Half-Orc scribe joined the party.

### Hobgoblins on the Road.
The team encountered [Fookwire](../people/fookwire), and then two Hobgoblin scouts, who were asking for papers, which the team did not have.  A fight ensued, and the party defeated the hobgoblins.  They stole their horses and armor, even with the obvious Osgani-guard-bred horses and brands.  Breckin and Kriv devised a cover for the brand that allowed the brand to look generally like an H and F, and they dubbed their group as the High Flyers.  This cover story seemed to work as they passed an entire garrison of Hobgoblins heading towards Hatham.

### Avery
Eventally the team made it to the town of [Avery](../places/avery), a small town.  They were tasked with delivering a crate to "Whippoorwill" in Avery, and they discovered that the barkeep, Gritta Bloodslasher was Whippoorwill.  She was their ally after delivery.  They investigated some murders and that led them to a suspicious priest, Brother Truthspeaker, who had been recently in town.  Gritta and Seventoes, were abducted in the night, and the party was led to a nearby abandoned cathedral, and came upon a cult.  They attacked the cultists, freed Seventoes and Gritta, but were under attack from other parties.

They pursued an attacker, eventually realizing he was a mind-controlled old colleague of Dredge's named [Jugger](../people/jugger).  He came out of the mind-control and joined the party, wanting to take revenge on his captor, Regas Firewind.  The party encountered Regas and Incubus, who was shapeshifted as beautiful woman and then as a man, and defeated him.  Jugger turned himself in for his crimes to be judged by the people of Avery.  Seventoes decided to stay to tell his story.

## Chapter 3: The Sunspire
The party continued on, passing [Yarrow Landing](../places/yarrow-landing).  They were led to a small roadside shrine by a mysterious plain woman, and the shrine showed signs of having been visited by [Belron](../people/belron), an old friend of Dorbis. Shortly after, the party arrived in [Ausanda](../places/ausanda), a city on the high plains.  They were to deliver the box to Franc, which they did.  They met [Raz Nixtel](../people/raz-nixtel), a Drow merchant, specializing in sketchy items.  They narrowly avoided detection by some Hobgoblins looking at their stolen horses.  Eventually they found that Belron had studied an old ruin nearbly, called [The Sunspire](../places/the-sunspire).  The party set out to go explore the Sunspire.

### Taking the Sunspire
The spire was inhabited by a few Gnolls and a Lamia who called herself Queen Xanesha, who escaped from the encounter.  The party took the hill, knowing that the Queen was likely to return.  The party discovered a few prisoners as well as the body of Belron, who had been deceased for a few days. Dorbis discovered old symbols related to Pelor.  He found that something would happen if he did a long-form Pelorian Ceremony, which he did.  A stairwell to the sky appeared, and the party climbed.

At the top, they found a suit of armor, glowing from the inside, which promptly attacked them.  After dispatching the suit of armor, it's captive, and angel of Pelor named Lykos was freed.  He granted each member of the party gifts, and granted Dorbis a Wish, which Dorbis used to return Belron to life.

The party returned to the top of the sunspire, find Belron returned to life.  They all prepared for battle.  Queen Xanesha, gnolls and skeletons attacked, and the party, along with the other prisoners (some barbarians from the nearby plains) and Belron dispatched them all.  Belron decided to stay and rebuild [the Sunspire](../places/the-sunspire) as a temple of Pelor.  The party continued on.  They reunited with [Jugger](../people/jugger) and [SevenToes](../people/seventoes), who had been proven innocent.  They joined the party.  Shortly after, a door appeared, and the party went to speak with Mephisto, who offered them an invitation to his party if they killed someone named Roger in Osgan.  He was apparently 12 feet tall and had 4 arms.

After they left the meeting, they were immediately apprehended (along with Jugger and SevenToes) by Hobgoblins.  They were brough in front of General Gruumsh, and his magician, [Radditz](../people/radditz), members of the [Unbroken Company](../factions/the-unbroken-company).  Radditz convinced Gruumsh to let them go see Ra'Jur, their contract holder in Osgan.  Gruumsh begrudgingly agreed after punching Breckin.

The party (excluding SevenToes and Jugger) teleported into the city, and was led below, down to the prison.

### Ea's Story
Ea was the Spymaster for the Osgani government, and her adopted father, Farrin Keldred, the Master of Swords, was leader of the Osgani military.  He was negotiating something with Delfond Flotterclan, and notified Ea of his leaving, to go to Delfond's cabin to work it out.

A few days later, long before her father was due back from the cabin, her father appeared in the city, but did not approach or talk to her.  The leadership starting making significant changes, and a group of mercenaries, the [Unbroken Company](../factions/the-unbroken-company) started to inhabit the city.  The City Guard was lured down into the barracks, and then locked inside by hobgoblins, which shortly took over.  Ea's father sent her an invitation to meet her in the prison, but she was tricked and locked inside by a female dragonborn.  Shortly after, the High Flyers party joined her in the prison.

## Chapter 4: Osgan Depths
The prisoners discovered a way to escape, and made their way down the great ramp, towards a secret door that Ea was able to open.  This door allowed the party into the Crypts, pursued by Hobgoblins and Bulettes.  They were able to escape through the crypts, and they went inside of an old private crypt, which they crawled through, finding a separate way through to get back into the main city.  They saved a gangster named Vitor, and his ladyfriend, who sadly, was slain in the crypts.

After they got back to the Osgan main city, they equipped themselves, but were quickly found by Kava Kimbatuul, Kriv's sister.  She had been granted significant powers by the Unbroken Company and fought the party, but she was defeated in the streets, igniting the Sixdays War.  

## Chapter 5: The Sixdays War
The party started guerilla warfare against the occupying force over the next few days.  They completed the following (with the help of Vitor and his gang), and the assistance of Reola Drent, a grandmother-figure to Ea.

Breckin discovered that the Harps and Sickles in Osgan had been neutered, and were unable to assist, but he found many plain folk willing to help the cause, and assisted in riling up the populace.

* Ambushes against standing guards in the streets.
* Discovery and killing of a doppelganger, posing as a member of high society.
* Locating and recovering all of the party's gear.
* Freeing all animals in the zoo into the Unbroken Company's HQ.
* Liberating the city guard from their prison.

This resulted in a requested meeting with Ra'Jur, a fiend from the Abyssal Plane (who had been hired by Mr. M to destabilize the region).  They went to meet with Ra'Jur and he offered them [The Aethon](../objects/the-aethon), an airship of unmatched quality and potential.  They declined, and Ra'Jur then reiterated his offer, revealing that was preparing to execute Reola, Vitor, SevenToes, and Jugger.  The party was able to free them, and they defeated Ra'Jur, who then offered them assistance were they ever to make it to the abyssal plane.  He also warned them against Mephisto's treachery.

## Epilogue: Threads still left untied.
The tides turned, and the city rose up for the next 3 days against the occupying force.  They were able to claw back certain sections of the city, and the eventually drove out the last of the Unbroken Company.  Many days of celebration followed, with pauses only for the funerals of great leaders of the city, including Ea's father, whose body was found.  Reola assisted in getting discussions rolling on how the people would be governed, but she denied any official roles.

Breckin was able to convince the reforming Osgani government to form around guilds of workers rather than nobility.  Dorbis assisted in recovery efforts, but was offered a job with Belron back at the sunspire.  Dredge was approached by an individual working for the Eastport Wizards who hoped to recruit him to their efforts, which he was encouraged to do by his superious officer.  Kriv stumbled into an artifact protection and retrieval contract with a mysterious antiquities dealer named Abergast.  Ea is given the option to become the Captain of the Osgan City Guard, or go hunt down the remainer of the Unbroken Company.

The party has yet to get the invitation to Mephisto's party.
