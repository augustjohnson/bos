* **Quest Giver** The Worm's Woe Founders
* **Type of Quest** This is not a standard quest, and will be almost completely played over slack, primarily asynchronously.
* **Number of Player Characters** One or two.
* **Player Character Requirements** Level 1. Some sort of background experience in building or managing a keep would be required.
* **Player Requirements** The ability to build out the lore, the maps, the growth of the Worm's Woe Headquarters, a fort that has almost no definition at this point.  This is a good quest for a primarily remote, busy individual.

## Posting
The Worm's Woe Headquarters needs to be improved.  It has barely been enough to hold together for the few festivities we've had, and is becoming a destination itself for people from various walks of life.  Luckily, the Wood Elves to the East, and the stable, peaceful Alvessian Kingdom to the West have helped the keep avoid any significant threats, but the world is dangerous.  The Keep needs to be prepared to grow, in capacity, stature, and renown.

Players may encounter unruly laborers, greedy merchants, and various horrible things in the unexplored crypts.
