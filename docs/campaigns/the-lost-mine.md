## The Adventure Begins
*"Meet Me in Phandalin."*

The characters are in the city of Alvesse when a dwarf and friend of Worm's Woe, Gundren Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthenâ€™s Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.
