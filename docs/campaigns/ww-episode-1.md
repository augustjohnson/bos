This episode was a one-shot made to test out the process and setup for Remote D&D.  It generally re-hashed a story that was played in the [../campaigns/the-high-flyers] chapter 2.  From a timeline continuity point of view, this is explained by a combination of two things.  First, [Avery](../places/avery) is cursed with cults for the rest of it's days, and second, the [Time Stone](../objects/the-time-stone) eroded the original memories of the inhabitants of town (and slightly changed some of them), and doomed them to repeat history, with some changes.

## Contract
The contract was granted to Worm's Woe, and Thea (in Althea form) gave it to four relatively new recruits.  They were given a few bucks and ticket to use the teleportation portal in Alvesse.  They teleported to Ausanda, and traveled for a few days towards Avery.

## Trouble in Avery

Eventally the team made it to the town of [Avery](../places/avery), a small village.  Grazz Bloodslasher, a half-orc barkeep wrote the contract and they checked in with him.  They investigated some murders and that led them to a suspicious priest, Brother Truthspeaker, who had been recently in town.  Grazz was abducted in the night, and the party was led to a nearby abandoned cathedral, and came upon a cult.  They attacked the cultists, freed Grazz, but were under attack from other parties.

They pursued an attacker, eventually realizing he was a mind-controlled old townie named Randall that they had seen in the bar.  He came out of the mind-control and assisted the party, wanting to take revenge on his captor, a demon.  The party fought, and defeated the demon that was masquerading as Brother Truthspeaker, a cambion.  Randall turned himself in for his crimes to be judged by the people of Avery.

The evidence inside the cathedral is clear, this demon, Brother Truthspeaker was charming individuals from nearby, for some unknown, strange purpose that involved kidnapping and killing.  There is evidence and Randall is your witness of all of this.  He corroborates your story, and also adds the detail that the missing individuals.  The contract is fulfilled.
