This episode was meant to explore the [Worm's Woe HQ](../places/worms-woe-hq) as well as the founders themselves.

## Being Watched
This campaign was specifically for the founders of Worm's Woe, who were almost by themselves at the Worm's Woe Headquarters during a very hot portion of summer.

Thea had been having a feeling of general foreboding for a while, and it started to rise to a feeling of specific foreboding.  She awoke her companions with a magical message after getting the feeling of being watched, and specifically seeing a Scying ball watching her while she was meditating.  Shortly after, while this feeling was contiuing to peak, four new recruits arrived.
* Farley, a halfling bard.
* Anna, a human fighter.
* Zelfinikus, a half-elf sorceror.
* Yup, a goblin rogue, Booyahg's cousin.

After meeting the new recruits, Thea uses a secret message to imply that one of them is the evil force.  She then suggests that they get tested by fighting a spider in an abandoned section of the castle.

## Testing The New Arrivals
There existed a crypt in the back of the small fort that the group had left untended for a few months, and an enterprising spider had moved in.  The new recruits were tasked with it's removal.  They crawled the crypts, nearly losing Farley.  It was unclear which of the characters was the imposter.  Farley was struck unconcious, and the team was able to drag him around until he recovered.

## The Foe, Revealed
After the team cleared the dungeon, they celebrated.  That night, Thea was interrupted while meditating by Anna, the girl, who revealed herself as a crone.  The crone used various complex spells to decommision Thea, and she did successfully.  She packed Thea into her bag (after reducing her size).  She was after [The Time Stone](../objects/the-time-stone), and immediately went to the vault. Luckily the vault was alarmed and Orin and Nefaris were awoken.  They ran down to fight, and eventually defeated the foe after a harrowing battle.  Thea was freed, and the threat was vanquished.

The rest of the new recruits were suspicious of the fact that they had been pitched into a fairly dangerous situation yesterday and the fact that one of them was now missing even though an illusion of her lay sleeping in her bunk.
