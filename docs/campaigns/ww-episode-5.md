# The Flame of the Everforge
This episode is a oneshot focusing on 3 members of [The Family](/factions/the-family). The Family received a contract from "client 7" to steal **The Flame of the Everforge**.  
In return the payment is "a favor".

Our protagonists will have to leave the material plane and venture into the Brass City in the elemental plane of fire.  Will they have what it takes to survive?

[Raw "Script"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v9Iza6VwZKxtY_rvXcv9bxeiz0o1h4kJHb6HhSsYQcQ/edit?usp=sharing) - Many on the fly changes happened with details due to time etc.

## The Contract
"Client 7" (Orin Ironbeard of Worm's Woe) is asking quite the taks. He reached out directly to [Glimmik](/people/glimmik-shadowshield) for this to happen.

Glimmik called on some of his most trusted and long time members of The Family for help.

Meeting in [Roystwick](/places/roystwick) at [The Hydra and The Horse](/places/the-hydra-and-the-horse), Glimmik lays out the details.

He hands them a [Brass Flask](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/388054-brass-flask) and a Bottle of cold laquer for their weapons (adding +0 cold damage).

It is said the Everforge resides in the depths of the Charcoal Palace.  Our opportunity to gain entrance to the Charcoal palace will be at the wedding of Lahab, son of Sultan Misheal, to Dukhani.

The wedding party takes place over a week.  Genies from all planes will be there, and all are welcome.  You will attend as Jann (description of Jann).  Using this potion.


## The Elemental Plane of Fire
Using a [Planeshift](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift) Staff, our "heroes" are teleported to the plane of fire.  They staff only has charges for each of them and 1 magic item each...magic items are costly to transport.
The staff is bound to "The Burning Hell's" tavern.

The staff also disguised our heroes as low level Efreet.  

Our heroes had some fun chats at the tavern before going to the Charcoal Palace.

### People in the Palace
**Sultan Misheal**:
Massive even for an Efreet, nearly as wide as he is tall.  Dressed in the finest robes, jewels weaved into intricate patterns.  On the back jewels are embedded into a map of the City of Brass


**Lahab**:
A perfect picture of an Efreet of the noble houses.  Eyes of fire, and hair a blaze Lahab seems to be made of pure fire.

Lahab is less of a tyrant than his father, and many of the City of Brass anticipate his rise to rule.


**Dukhani**:
Dukhani is a slender Efreet.  Daughter of a powerful merchant family and extremely clever.  Behind the scenes she runs the Guild of Brass, and hopes to use her soon to be had position to expand her familyâ€™s influence into other markets
