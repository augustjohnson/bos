## Bag Drop
*Simple trap* (level 1-4, dangerous threat)

Assembly Time | Environment 
--- | --- 
10 minutes | Anything with anchoring points above and around a path.

**Materials**
* Item to drop (Caltrops, Ball bearings, Vial of Acid, Rocks)
* Container (bag, bucket, vial)
* 30ft of string

With proper care, an item can be rigged with a tripwire to be dropped on an unsuspecting victim.  The effect can be anything from comical to dangerous.
**Trigger**
A tripwire strung across a hallway is rigged to bag or container. If the tripwire is broken, the object falls on intruders.
**Effect**
The contents of the container fall onto a 5-foot-by-5-foot area centered on the tripwire. Any creature fully within this area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the object.
* Rocks - 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
* Caltrops - 1 piercing damage. Movement speed is reduced by 10ft until healed.
* Ball Bearings - The creature falls prone.
* Vial of Acid - 2d6 acid damage.
**Countermeasures**
A DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check reveals the tripwire and the net. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables the tripwire without dropping the net or ringing the bell; failing the check causes the trap to activate.

## Tripwire
*Simple trap* (level 1 – 4, no threat)

Assembly Time | Environment 
--- | --- 
1 minute | Anything with anchoring points above and around a path.
**Materials**
* 30ft of string
* Iron bell

Sometimes simple wires that ring bells are enough to help.
**Trigger**
A tripwire strung across a walking area is rigged. An iron bell is also rigged to the tripwire. It rings when the trap activates, alerting nearby guards.
**Effect**
A creature touching the tripwire causes the bell to ring.
**Countermeasures**
A DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check reveals the tripwire. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables the tripwire without ringing the bell; failing the check causes the trap to activate.


## Bear Trap
*Simple trap* (level 1 – 4, dangerous threat)

Assembly Time | Environment 
--- | --- 
1 minute | Soft ground, or somewhere to solidly fasten the stake.

**Materials**
* A Bear Trap
* A 5ft chain or rope.
* Stake
* Hammer

A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs shut when stepped on, clamping down on a creature’s leg. The trap is spiked in the ground, leaving the victim immobilized.
**Trigger.**
A creature that steps on the bear trap triggers it.
**Effect.**
The trap makes an attack against the triggering creature. The attack has a +8 attack bonus and deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit.
This attack can’t gain advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap has its speed reduced to 0. It can’t move until it breaks free of the trap with a successful Strength check (DC 15) made by it or another creature adjacent to the trap.
**Countermeasures.**
* A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trap. 
* A DC 10 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables it.

## Pit Trap
*Simple trap* (level 1 – 4, dangerous threat)

Assembly Time | Environment 
--- | --- 
4 hours | Soft ground (or an existing pit can be modified).

**Materials**
* Shovel
* Tarp
* Hammer and Stakes

This trap consists of a 10-foot deep pit, concealed by a tattered canvass covered with leaves and dirt. This type of trap is useful for blocking off the entrance to a monster lair and usually has narrow, safe ledges along its sides. 
**Trigger**
Anyone stepping on the canvass might fall into the pit.
**Effect**
The triggering creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature catches on the pit’s edge or instinctively steps back. Otherwise, the creature falls into the pit and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.
**Countermeasures**
* A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the canvass. 
* A 1ft-wide ledge around the pit is safe to cross.

## Net Trap
*Simple trap* (level 1-4, dangerous threat)

Assembly Time | Environment 
--- | --- 
10 minutes | Anything with anchoring points above and around a path.

**Materials**
* Net
* 30ft of string
* Iron bell

Goblins, with their propensity to enslave their enemies, prefer traps that leave intruders intact for work in the goblins’ mines or elsewhere.
**Trigger**
A tripwire strung across a hallway is rigged to a large net. If the tripwire is broken, the net falls on intruders. An iron bell is also rigged to the tripwire. It rings when the trap activates, alerting nearby guards.
**Effect**
A net covering a 10-foot-by-10-foot area centered on the tripwire falls to the floor as a bell rings. Any creature fully within this area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or berestrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to try to free itself or another creature inthe net. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees a creature without harming the creature.
**Countermeasures**
A DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check reveals the tripwire and the net. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves’ tools disables the tripwire without dropping the net or ringing the bell; failing the check causes the trap to activate.
