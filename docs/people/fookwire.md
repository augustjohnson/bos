Fookwire is a magical item salesman.  He is a human, older, with a wispy beard.  He speaks in a creaky voice, but is overly generous with things that can be had for free with his magical items (such as food and drink).  When encountered on the trail, he usually offers both a fantastic meal as well as good prices on magical items.

## Fookwire's Carriage
The carriage is very tall, and has items strapped and packed all over it.  It appears to be more of a gypsy carriage than a rich man’s carriage, with pots and pans strapped all over it among other, less recognizable objects.  The strangest thing about it is that it appears to be floating, it’s not touching the ground at all, and in fact, it doesn’t have any wheels.  It is also drawn by four llamas.

## Dr. Worm
Fookwires assistant and bodyguard is an enormous, slack jawed, and barely human.  Over 8 feet tall, hugely wide (enough to where the seat has to be significantly modified for him.  He is actually a Flesh Golem in fookwire's service.
