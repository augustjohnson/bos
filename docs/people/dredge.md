# {{ page.title }}
A current member of The Eastport Wizards Spire, member of The High Flyers, and former Iron Fist.

Dredge isn't your typical eldritch knight.  Essentially born into the Iron Fists, Dredge found his love for magic.  During his time with The High Flyers he found the opportunity to dive deeper into the world of the arcane.

After the 6 Days War, Dredge was given the opportunity to leave the Iron Fists and become a member of The Eastport Wizards Spire.  

## Backstory
At the typical age of 4, Dredge was enlisted in the First Fists.  Here Dredge was taught to about how the mages corrupted the lands, and it was the Iron Fist's duty to ensure they never return to power.

Dredge was an astute student.  By the age of 6 he could feel the presence of the captured mages when they were close.  He was quickly selected to be trained more in the arts...to someday hunt down the dreaded mages.

Over the years in school Dredge spent time learned to fight the magic arts.  After training was over Dredge would sneak into the lower halls of the of the forbidden library to study the arcane knowledge there.  He wanted to learn to think like the enemy. Dredge spent every waking hour reading and studying the arts to the discouragement of his teachers.

When Dredge was 13, his master was so disturbed about Dredge's studies of the arts, he accused him of being a practitioner.  Dredge challenged Master Morgar to trial by armed combat.  Dredge quickly put the High Master down.


The high lord was made aware of the situation, and granted Dredge full access to the forbidden library and tasked him with acquiring tombs for his collection.

Dredge proved himself well in this endeavor by growing the high lord's library by more than has been seen in the past decade.  His leadership abilities were well known, and his insight to his enemy's were unmatched.

Dredge was recently promoted to rank of Arcane Hunter of the Prime Company.  Dredge was tasked to take the Blood Troop into the Frebrand Range to hunt a rogue group of archaists who have been recruiting around Doraund.  Their main objective is to capture or kill the leader, Regas Firewind.

During the fall of the winter the Blood Troop began to lose to the elements.  4 fists were lost to frostbite, and another two fell victims of Firewind's band.

The troop fled in all directions.  Dredge and the remains of the command went west to Hatham.  However more fell to the elements.  By the time Dredge reached Hatham, the only surviving member was SevenToes (Dredge's Scribe).

Dredge is determined to put an end to Regas and his band before he returns to the High Command, but first he needs to find and rebuild his troop.  He found work in Hatham to help fund his revenge.
