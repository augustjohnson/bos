				Unit details unknown<br>
Jugger Details -
Jugger is an old Arcane Hunter with many mages falling at his hand, his counts are well over 20. He’s one of the most intimidating humans I have ever encountered, nearly as tall as my orcish mother! His red fist armor is bright with his enemy’s blood, and the same can be said for his mighty hammer.  Jugger carries no shield and refuses to wear a helm…as both stand between him and his prey.<br>
Dredge Details -
Dredge is one of the youngest Hunters I have served with. There is no question of his qualifications of his rank, and its clear he will rise high. That said I can’t stand him. His hate for the corruptors is unlike any I have ever encountered. Most Fists are interested in exterminating the practitioners, Dredge is more inclined to study them.  If he had his way, they would be enslaved to serve us. His quarters are full of spell books, and history of Mages and Warlocks.  I do not know how the Reclaimer lets him get away with so many Arcane artifacts. His knowledge of the arts make the troops uncomfortable. Many even say they can feel his presence much as they do with our prey, and do not wish to associate with him. If you ask me his quest for knowledge has tainted his purity.<br>
Mortith Details -
True hunter of our Troop. Mortith was raised in the wild with his Ranger father until the age of 12.  He came to us after a clan of Druids behead his father for trespassing. Mortith had a crow companion which helped with the scouting. I do not know how they communicate, but its unsettling. I believe Mortith’s crow still lives as I swear continue to see it in the trees...but then again, all crows look the same.<br>
SevenToes Details -
I came to Valmest as a son of a prisioner, my Mother Umani.  Her Orc tribe traveled out of the mountains towards Valmest during a long drought looking for food. During the night they were attacked by the Iron Fist.  It was well known the tribe was lead by the Warlock Boroc. Most escaped, but not by mother. <br>
During her capture she was a slave for the Smith’s Guild. She fell in love with one of the Reclaimer’s servent’s.  How she met him and what he saw in her I will never know. He bought her for his house guard and I was born in secret.<br>
I took after my father in about every way except my statue. Languages came easy to me as a child. Before the age of 10 I could speak common, orcish, elvish, and undercommon. My father raised me in the ways of the Iron Fist. My clumsy limbs did me know good, but my affinity for language made me an excellent candidate for the Fist’s academy to become a keeper of records.<br>
During the entry trials I made quite the fool of myself. My first and only battle exam left me without half a foot, earning me my “true name” SevenToes. This will be my 8th year of service.
Current Mission:
Blood Troop has been tasked to hunt down Regas Firewind,.  Reports place his followers in Frebrand Range.<br>
Our Troop is lead by 3 Arcane Hunters, headed up by the most senior Jugger.  Each Hunter commands a platoon of thirteen. Most are fresh and have never encountered the corruptors.<br>
Log -
- Two Days Ago -
We’ve been ambushed at the southern pass.  The enemy stalked us through the storm, but we had no option, we had to go through. We saw the remains of Bravo troop who was caught by the storm a mile back.<br>
Firewind’s troops were waiting for us. Our platoon fled as did I.  I happened to regroup with Arcane Hunter Dredge of Bravo and we made our way to Hatham.<br>
Dredge has a plan to rebuild our platoon. We think more will show up in Hatham, and we can buy replacements for who doesn’t...the only problem is our supplies, including our gold is back at the pass. We will need to find a way to pay for our troops...or beg forgiveness of the Reclaimer and prey he sends us reinforcements.<br>
- One Day Ago -
Dredge found some possible work in Hatham. It doesn't’ look like it pays much, but we need it. We can’t hire anyone if we can’t pay to feed ourselves. Few seem to offer credit to the Iron Fist.  I will have to remember to write to the High Reclaimer suggesting we establish an outpost here.  Many have forgotten the sins of the corruptors.
