Welcome to the basic explainer of the Universe of the Bureau of Space.

It's about 150 years in the future from the present day.  This story takes place inside of our solar system.
1. Humans have colonized most of the reasonably survivable solar system.
2. Interplanetary travel is common, and enjoyed by a large group.  Think of it like intercontinental flying is in the present day.
3. An organization called the Bureau of Space has oversight into many of official activities traveling between these systems.
4. There are no aliens or intelligent life of any sort that's non-terrestrial in origin.
5. There is no magic.
6. There is no faster-than-light travel.
