title: The Universe of BS

Welcome to the basic explainer of the Universe of the Bureau of Space.

It's about 150 years in the future, and a lot of things have happened.  The ones that need to be noted are as follows.
1. Humans have colonized most of the reasonably survivable solar system.
2. Interplanetary ships mostly use engines that can support 1G constant acceleration/decelleration.
3. An organization called the Bureau of Space has oversight into many of official activities traveling between these systems.
4. There's no aliens or intelligent life of any sort that's non-terrestrial in origin.
5. There's no magic.
6. Physics as we know it have not been violated (running under the assumption that a fusion based ~1G acceleration engine is possible)
