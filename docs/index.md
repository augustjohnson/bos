# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation of the shared world.  This is a fantasy world, originally specced out by Mike, then built onto by August, Chad and Kyle.  This site is an attempt to catalog and organize details about the world to make it a richer place for all players playing in the world (in the last 2 months, 15 different players and 3 different DMs have shared some version of this world).
