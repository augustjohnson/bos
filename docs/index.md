# The Universe

Welcome to the late 22nd century.  Humans have advanced their position throughout the solar system, but old problems persist, along with some new ones. The Universe of BS is a place where the lucky are rewarded beyond their wildest dreams and the unlucky are sent through an airlock. 

Imagine asking someone living in the 1860s what they expect 2020 to look like.  That's roughly how far off we currently are from the timeline we'll be playing in.  Many things are different are different for the better.  Many things that were unthinkable then are commonplace now.

Here are a few of the foundational changes in the Universe of BS.
1. Humans have colonized most of the reasonably survivable solar system.
2. Interplanetary travel is common, and enjoyed by a large group.  Think of it like intercontinental flying is in the present day.
3. An organization called the **Bureau of Space** has oversight into activities traveling between these systems.
4. There are no aliens or intelligent life of any sort that's non-terrestrial in origin.
5. There are entities generally called [Minds](./minds).  These are machines originally created by humans with at least human-level intelligence. There has been no killer AI apocalypse, and humans do not serve at the altar of AGI.
6. There is no magic.
7. There is no faster-than-light travel.  Humans are generally limited to our solar system, and relativity has limited any sort of human influence to only barely touch the nearest stars.

## The Worlds
See each of the world's pages for details, but here's a primer:
* Mars is a population center, many live there, and many more visit it.
* Inhabitable places have been built on most of the larger bodies across the solar system, and some free-floating colonies have been built.
* A few hollowed out asteroids have been spun to produce artificial gravity through centrifugal force.
* Most non-terrestrial environments aim for about 0.5G to serve both terrans and voidborn.

## The People
As far as inhabitants are concerned, the following things are commonplace:
* Humans that are born in environments that are less than 1g are nearly always recognizable on sight because of their lanky dimensions and underdeveloped muscles compared to earthborn.
* Many humans have brain implants to get information to and from their brain.  A cell-phone for their brain.
* A few humans have cybernetic body parts, or body modifications.
