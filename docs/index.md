# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation of the shared world.  This is a fantasy world, originally specced out by Mike, then built onto by August, Chad and Kyle.  This site is an attempt to catalog and organize details about the world to make it a richer place for all players playing in the world (in the last 2 months, 15 different players and 3 different DMs have shared some version of this world).

## The World
Please visit [The World](places/the_world.md)

## Places
There are many places in the world, (and growing all the time).  Some highlights include:
* [Osgan](places/osgan.md)
* [Ausanda](places/ausanda.md)
* [The Worm's Woe Headquarters](places/worms_woe_hq.md)
* [Valence](places/valence.md)

### The Western Continent
The western continent is fairly well contained and has four mountain ranges and five major rivers.  It is well settled and has few truly wild areas.

### The Eastern Continents
The Northern island has a central mountain range (the Frebrand range) and many islands (mostly parts of the Orcish Isles).  It stretches from the Northcrown, a cold wasteland to the Strait of Agnuan seperating it from the Southern Island.

The southern island has a small central mountain range as well, and is home to both the corruption and the High Elves.

## People
The inhabitants of this world are what make it interesting.  Notable inhabitants can be found in the /people folder.  Here are a few examples.
* [Fookwire](people/fookwire.md)
* [The Flotterclan Family](people/the_flotterclan_family.md)
* [Ra'jur](people/rajur.md)
