Airships exist throughout the known world, but are almost completely owned and managed by the ultra-wealthy or royalty.  They are expensive and dangerous, as well as fairly slow compared to travel on overland roads.  A few, such as [the Aethon](../objects/the_aethon.md) are formidable enough to fly over the lairs of dragons, but most are simply.

## Creating an Airship
The Majority of Airships are created in the Osgan Airshipworks by a combination of dwarven and human craftsmen.

## Powering an Airship
Some simply float, non-magically using gasses from mines, and using sailing principles to navigate.  These are usually smaller, purpose built vehicles, for example to go up and down a local mountain pass, or thrown together by a goblin party to raid a remote monastery.  Other airships use elementals magically tethered to an engine to power enormous fans.  Others use magical crystals.
