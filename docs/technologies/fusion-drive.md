The Fusion Drive, invented by Abigail "Krylon" Turnbull was a huge advancement in space travel, allowing for energy efficient, constant accelleration. The drives are well understood, low maintenace, and they have well understood failure modes.  They've proven to be quite safe, with the very rare spectalar nuclear explosion.
