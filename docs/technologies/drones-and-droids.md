# Drones and Droids
Drones and droids are self-propelled machines built to interact with the world. They nearly always have remote operators, but are occasionally self-contained.  They are a fairly common sight in populated areas, both as assistants to humans and as avatars of minds.

Drones can be damaged and repaired

## Drones
Drones can be extended in many different ways, but commonly have sensors for visible light, depth, and sound, and some basic communication back, like speakers or a screen.  It's common to find a copter drone (less than 3kg) whizzing around human establishments either carrying small cargo or scanning for information.

Drones with more potential capabilities (onboard lasers, large mass) are regulated, and more rare except in work sites.

## Droids
A droid is a machine that can generally move like a human, with two legs, and (usually) two arms.  Quadrapedal droids are fairly common too.  Droid is a class of drone officially, but certain designs bear many benefits over flying type drones, such as significantly higher energy storage capabilities, and the ability to use human tools.

### Bipedal Droid (*Tin Man*)

| _Drone, common_ | 
|:-------------|
| _This mass produced droid body is a fairly common sight in most cities.  It's thin-framed body is built of reinforced metals and ceramics, and is quite durable. It has the maximum allowed strength for non-military droid models.  It has the standard sensor array and they are commonly modified with additional sensors depending on the needs of a particular droid._ |
