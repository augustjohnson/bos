Fort Yox is an old military fort near [Osgan](../places/osgan), and has historically been a base for it's military.  It's built on the side of a mountain with very little nearby, and it's a wide fort, more built for the ability to hold thousands of soldiers than it is to survive a siege or direct attack.  It has low walls, many temporary buildings and a large training ground.  There's a small city nearby that mostly supports the fort when it's occupied.  It was the base of the [Unbroken Company](../factions/unbroken-company) and their leader, General Gruumsh during the occupation of Osgan.
