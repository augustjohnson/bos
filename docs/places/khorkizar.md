Khorkizar is a southern port city on the southeastern continent.  It's at the mouth of a river, in a bay, and the landscape around it has many buttes and cliffs.  The river is called the "Booble" by locals, but many maps have it labeled as the "Alorivna."  The town of Khorkizar is mostly built on the hilly eastern shores.

The has a much higher than normal population of High Elves, as it is geographically close to [Valence](../places/valence), the High Elf homeland.  It also serves as as point of trade with that city, which generally shuns outsiders (and is incredibly difficult to get to).  It has a fantastic beach, and warm, temperate weather.  There are many farmlands nearby that are flooded each year when the rains come.  Living in the city itself are many stevedores and longshoremen.  The city itself is old, but the central plaza is extremely old, perhaps from as far back as the [Fifth Age](../history/world-history).

## The Timekeepers of Khorkizar
A cult of sorts runs an incredible device that overlooks Khorkizar.  They have done so for centuries untold, through many wars.  The device tells time, seasons, and various other complex (some still mysterious) attributes of the passage of time.  See [An Academic Inquiry into the Timekeepers of Khorkizar](../history/the-timekeepers-of-khorkizar) for information on the timekeepers.
