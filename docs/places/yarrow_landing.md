# Yarrow Landing
Yarrow landing is a town north of [Ausanda](ausanda.md) on the north-eastern continent.  It swears fealty to Osgan. It is mainly a shipping town, with cargo floating in downriver from Ausanda.  It’s on a lake, just above an enormous waterfall, so cargo cannot pass by.  The saying goes that the town has more docks than residents. Ships unload their wares into great caravans of grain, spices, and other goods shipped down from the mountains to be shipped again from Avery, or to make the whole trade route down to Hatham.

The town is full of docks on one side of the lake, and has significant storehouses and granaries as well.  As far as the total number of people, it’s almost certainly more than Avery, but it’s hard to tell because many of them are only there temporarily, as a pass through.  The city proper is walled, with 20ft high stone walls, but still quite small.  There are a few buildings on the outside of the walls, with one clearly being the stable.  Across from the stable is a building that at first glance appears to be abandoned, but looking close you can see a few candles inside, and as you pass a woman who appears to be wearing more dirt and soot than clothes comes out to hock her wares.
