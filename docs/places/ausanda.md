# Ausanda
Ausanda is a sprawling city in on the western high desert of the north-eastern continent.  Its subjects swear fealty to [Osgan](osgan.md).  It has no walls and many two and three story wooden buildings, as well as an older part of the city, built along the river with buildings of sandstone.  There’s a small walled portion, a military camp and buildings.  It is overseen by a Lord, whose manor is visible from the city up on the hill above it.  He is not usually interested in cleaning up the city itself, mostly just in taxing it's residents.

## Climate
Ausanda is geographically in a high plains area, with mountains visible to the east.  The land is not particularly fertile.  The days are hot and the nights are cold, and the sun is particularly bright.  Rarely, if ever does it rain, and there are few trees in the city.  Low, windswept pines are common out on the desert plains.  There are some grasses, but not many.

## Residents
Ausanda has historically been a city defined by it's squalor.  The enormous slums are separated from the wealthy portion of the city by guards who turn away those unworthy on sight.  This is enforced across a river, with each bridge having it's own set of guards.  The city is mostly human, but all races are represented here.

### Notable Residents
* **Franc**, the human administrator of the colliseum.  He's moderately corrupt, if not specifically evil, and will do many things for money.
* **Raz Nixtel**, a Drow proprietor of a shop of unsavory items.  He does not ask what you do with his wares, as it would probably implicate him.

## Neighborhoods
**The Hovels,** is an area of town of squalor and self-built buildings.  City guards don’t go there, an there are lots of thieves guild symbols, they appear to be the law in the area.  The area is under the protection of Toothy Rik, a huge (fat) dragonborn, who occasionally eats his victims.  Rik has gained weight recently.

**Across the River** is where the nobles and wealthy folk live, and most of the permanent infrastructure is.  Builds are tall and built of sandstone, and the streets are mostly safe.

## Travel
Ausanda does not have a teleportation circle.  The first town to the north is [Yarrow Landing](yarrow_landing.md), and to the south is [Fort Yox](fort_yox.md).  There is a moderately developed road between all of these places.  West of Ausanda is the [Yarrow Badlands](yarrow_badlands.md)
