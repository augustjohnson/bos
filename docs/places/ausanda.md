# Ausanda
![Ausanda River Crossing](ausanda.jpg "Ausanda River Crossing")
Ausanda is a sprawling city in on the western high desert of the north-eastern continent.  Its subjects swear fealty to Osgan.  It has no walls and many two and three story wooden buildings, as well as an older part of the city, built along the river with buildings of sandstone.  There’s a small walled portion, a military camp and buildings.

## Residents
Ausanda has historically been a city of squalor.  The enormous slums are separated from the wealthy portion of the city by guards who turn away those unworthy on sight.  This is enforced across a bridge.  The city is mostly human, but all other types are represented here.

### Notable Residents
* **Franc**, the human administrator of the colliseum.  He's moderately corrupt, if not specifically evil, and will do many things for money.
* **Raz Nixtel**, a Drow proprietor of a shop of unsavory items.  He does not ask what you do with his wares, as it would probably implicate him.

## Neighborhoods
**The Hovels,** is an area of town of squalor and self-built buildings.  City guards don’t go there, an there are lots of thieves guild symbols, they appear to be the law in the area.  If they ask around the area is under the protection of Toothy Rick, a huge (fat) dragonborn, who occasionally eats his victims.  Rick has gained weight recently.

**Across the River** is where the nobles and wealthy folk live, and most of the permanent infrastructure is.  Builds are tall and built of sandstone, and the streets are mostly safe.
