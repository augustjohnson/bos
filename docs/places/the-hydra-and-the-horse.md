# The Hydra and The Horse
The tavern is a single story stone-walled building, with a black tile roof and elf-wrought tables and chairs. Accommodations consist of several large rooms with beds and feather mattresses. The inn once belonged to a wizard, and a small fire elemental still dwells in the hearth.

The tavern is commonly used by [The Family](../factions/the-family.md) as a base of operations in [Roystwick](roystwick.md). They drop in and out to assign missions and use it to find new recruits.

## Barkeep
Edvin. He's run the bar for 30 years.

He's a balding, unbearded human, who never smiles, and keeps a watchful eye on his particularly flirtacious young wife (his fourth wife overall), the bar wench.

"What'll ye 'ave then?"

"Troll sweat is a copper for a mug, but it'll turn yer pee black."

"Griffon Tears is a gold for a glass. But you sort don't look like yer the spendin' type."

## Barwench
Lally

Younger human female. Plain bar wench clothes, slightly stained. No shoes.

Clumsy, with more than 3 drinks on a platter, she has a 20% chance of dropping it, which her husband will curse about.

"You boys look thirsty!"

To any women at the table. "Do these boys behave themselves ladies? I hope not!"

"The fish is half off, like my top!"
