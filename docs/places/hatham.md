Hatham is a city on the north western coast of the northeastern island continent.  It has historically pledged to Osgan, but that bond has always been tenuous as it's so remote.  It's denizens are primarily human with a larger-than-standard share of dwarves becuase of the nearby mining operations.  Other races are represented here as well.  The population of the city itself is around 10,000, but that varies significantly from season to season as new mines open up.  Few of those grew up in Hatham.

## Recent History
Hatham has found that there are significant resources in the mountains surrounding it, and various dwarven factions have taken to starting to mine them.  This has resulted in many dwarven and human miners, flush with cash, using Hatham as base of operations.  It has become something of a boom town because of this, with a new street being built up on the hill above the old city with dozens of inns, taverns, and brothels.  The old city remains below.

The city is very compressed, and on a steep hillside, with streets usually too narrow for carts, so it's most often walked, or occasionally ridden on a horse (but many places can be tricky to navigate on a full size horse).  The old city has buildings made of stone and stucco, and streets of cobblestone, but the new city is mostly built out of harvested wood and logs.

## After the Sixdays War
Shortly before the occupation of Osgan, an entire garrison of the [Unbroken Company](../factions/unbroken-company) was stationed in Hatham, and they immediately declared martial law, and occupied the city.  The limited ingress and egress to checkpoints, and arrested many on shaky pretenses.

After the defeat of Ra'Jur, and the [Sixdays War](../history/sixdays-war), the greater Unbroken Company was disbanded, and their leader, General Gruumsh was lost.  The occupiers of Hatham remained, and fortified their position as the law in Hatham.  It remains occupied, as it provides little strategic value, and gives significant geographic advantages to the occupying force.

The occupiers now call themselves The Last Company.
