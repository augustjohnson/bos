# The Northcrown
The Northcrown is the domain of the Iron Fists.  Geographically, it stretches from near the top of the Frebrand Mountains, up to the tip of the continent.  It contains Doraund along with various other villages and towns.  It is mostly human by population.

## Valmest
Valmest is the holy city of [The Iron Fists](../factions/iron_fists.md).  It is ancient, and mostly populated by humans.  The town is 98% human, and the remainder is mostly visitors or prisoners.  Dwarves and the Iron Fists often get along fairly well, so dwarven regiments will occasionally be in town for training or to mine a nearby vein of mithral.  The city often has snowfall, and the sea nearby has occasional icebergs.

### The Temple of the Iron Fists
The Holy Temple of the Iron Fists is in the center of the city, and is in active use today.  It is a well protected, very utilitarian structure.  It is the home of both the Reclaimer and the High Reclaimer, the two religious leaders of the Iron Fists.

## The Swamp
There is a swamp on the western shore, south of Valmest a ways.  It's a place that many hags have been hunted and killed by the Iron Fists.
