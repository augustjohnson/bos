Milwood Forest is the homeland of the Wood Elves, and borders Alvesse, a larger human settlement.  The more central districts are contrlled by wood-elves, but the outskirts have bests of many types, Owlbears, Goblins, many other.

## Felwen
Very few outsiders ever get the opportunity to visit Felwen, the magical tree at the center of Milwood Forest and most precious haven of the Wood Elves.  Outsiders without specific invitation of a member of high standing can be (and are) killed on sight.
