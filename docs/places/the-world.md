### The Western Continent
The western continent is fairly well contained and has four mountain ranges and five major rivers.  It is well settled and has few truly wild areas.

### The Eastern Continents
The Northern island has a central mountain range (the Frebrand range) and many islands (mostly parts of the Orcish Isles).  It stretches from the Northcrown, a cold wasteland to the Strait of Agnuan seperating it from the Southern Island.

The southern island has a small central mountain range as well, and is home to both the corruption and the High Elves.
