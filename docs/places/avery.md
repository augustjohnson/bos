# Avery
The town of Avery is a small town with a town square.  Many residents are farmers and a few traders.  It gets a fair amount of traffic on horseback from [Yarrow Landing](yarrow_landing.md) and [Ausanda](ausanda.md).  It is built near the White River.  The town is almost all human.  There are roughly 100 residents nearby.

## Notable Residents
* **Ol’ Quickfingers.**  He’s an unapologetic thief by trade, in an out of jail for years.  He’s been to the cracked cathedral and can tell them about it.  Talks like a pirate.
* **Lizel Smitchfield** Town Lord (Mayor/Baronet). Called Lord Smitchfield. He’s very suspicious of everything, but mostly just amorphously suspicious.
* **Milt Brightwood** Watchman and Constable. Lackey of Lord Smitchfield.  No real sense of justice.  Wary of travelers.

## Notable Locations
* **Town Hall** A large, stone building in the center of town, facing an open, mowed lot.  It’s about 3 floors tall with a basement, and is the second largest building** in town.  Pretty much fully occupied by Hobgoblin forces, who hang out on the front steps looking menacing.  Has a jail in the basement, and Lord Smitchfield’s quarters.
* **Avery Chapel** - A fairly recently (last 40 years) built beautiful stone church, with large stained glass windows.  It’s well built, but practical.  It is the tallest building with small belltower protruding from the top of the steeple.
* **Stables** - Simple wood buildings, but able to hold a few horses. Lots of well-bred horses in there, with Osgan Council brands.  In there is Griffin Powers.
* **Mine** - Iron mine, only a few miners these days, it doesn’t produce much any more. Mostly farming and trading.
* **Market** - Open every day except the day of the funeral.
* **The Chipped Tankard** - High end Tavern/bar.  Taken over by the Hobgoblin Company.  Hobgoblins turn away the adventurers.  “No vacancy.”
* **Squelching Frog** - Local drinking establishment and Inn.  A little sketchy.  Has a Harp and Sickle scratched onto the wall next to the door.
* **Cracked Cathedral** - Barely visible far up on the hill above the town. Townspeople mention it used to be the church but a few decades ago a terrible thing happened and it hasn’t been usable since.  Was way overbuilt hundreds of years ago, a vision of a fanatic.  It was abandoned after a cataclysm made it uninhabitable.
