Eastport is one of the largest cities in the world, a bustling burg of many races, many professions and both seedy quarters as well as significant nobility.  The Eastport Wizard's Spire, a magical tower managed by the [Eastport Wizards](../factions/the-eastport-wizards) dominates the skyline, but they do not rule the city.  All kinds can be found here.  It is a port city.

The thick gates that surround the Great City have twelve, tall guard towers placed at strategic intervals, so that the Wizard's Spire acts as an enormous sundial, with the evenly-spaced guard towers marking the long hours.  For those magical elite at the top of the altitudinous Spire, the city far below can be used to measure time.
