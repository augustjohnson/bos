Eastport is one of the largest cities in the world, a bustling burg of many races, many professions and both seedy quarters as well as significant nobility.  The Eastport Wizard's Spire, a magical tower managed by the [Eastport Wizards](../factions/the-eastport-wizards) dominates the skyline, but they do not rule the city.  All kinds can be found here.  It is a port city.
