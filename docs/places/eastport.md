Eastport is one of the largest cities in the world, a bustling burg of many races, many professions and both seedy quarters as well as significant nobility.  The Eastport Wizard's Spire, a magical tower managed by the [Eastport Wizards](../factions/the-eastport-wizards) dominates the skyline, but they do not rule the city.  All kinds can be found here.  It is a port city.

The tall gates that surround the city have guard towers placed at strategic intervals, so that the Wizard's Spire acts as a sundial, with the guard towers marking the hours.  For those elite at the top of the Spire, the city below can be used to measure time.
