## Barbarian: Path of the Cyborg (Path of the Zealot)
Many individuals see bionics as an extension of their humanity and will, allowing them to accomplish things inconceivable to unmodified humans. You have cybernetic implants with various effects on your abilities.

### Charged Up (replaces Divine Fury)
Starting when you choose this path at the 3rd level, you can use a cybernetic implant to strengthen your weapon strikes.  While you're raging, the first creature you hit with a strength-based weapon attack on each of your turns takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level.  The extra damage is the same type that the weapon already deals.

### Redundant Organs (replaces Warrior of the Gods)
At 3rd level, your implants can help you survive death, and your body decomposes extremely slowly.  If an activity would restore you to life, the person giving medical aid can identify that your extra organs can be brought online quickly and easily, restoring you without complex equipment.

### Focus Meds (replaces Fanatical Focus)
Starting at 6th level, the drugs that fuel your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while youâ€™re raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

__All other class features remain the same.__
