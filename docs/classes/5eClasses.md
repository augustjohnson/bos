In addition, custom classes may be made, but need to be a re-skinning of an existing class with a in-universe set of abilities well-thought out and explained for at least the first 10 levels.

For Example, Rogue: Arcane Trickster with a go-go-gadget hand instead of mage hand legerdemain, and each spell you plan to take up to Level 10 needs to be re-skinned.

If any abilities of the new class has a magical component to it, it must be re-skinned. A custom page (in this same directory) must be made for the new class.

The following reskinned class is also available:

* [Fighter: Personal Maneuvering System Expert](/classes/FighterPMS)
