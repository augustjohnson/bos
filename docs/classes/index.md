The following standard DND 5e classes are allowed in this campaign:

* Barbarian: Path of the Battlerager (No racial requirement)
* Barbarian: Path of the Berserker
* Barbarian: Path of the Totem Warrior
* Fighter: Champion
* Fighter: Battle Master

* Monk: Way of the Open Hand
* Rogue: Assassin
* Rogue: Inquisitive
* Rogue: Mastermind
* Rogue: Scout
* Rogue: Swashbuckler
* Rogue: Thief

In addition, custom classes may be made, but need to be a re-skinning of an existing class with a in-universe set of abilities well-thought out and explained for at least the first 10 levels. 

Example 1, Rogue: Arcane Trickster with a go-go-gadget hand instead of mage hand legerdemain, and each magical spell you plan to take up to Level 10 needs to be re-skinned for a no-magic, technology-focused world, including explanations based in science on how it would work.

Example 2, Cleric: Forge domain could be a skilled engineer with a set of tricks based on custom technology that theiy have created.

Example 3, Cleric Light domain could just be lasers.

If any abilities of the new class has a magical component to it (such as a Channel Divinity), it must be re-skinned. A custom page (in this same directory) must be made for the new class.

The following reskinned classes are also available:

* [Fighter: Personal Maneuvering System Expert](./FighterPMS)
* [Barbarian: Contingency Planner](./BarbarianCP)
