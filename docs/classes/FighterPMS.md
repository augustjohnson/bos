## Fighter: Personal Maneuvering System Expert (Cavalier)

The archetypal PMS Expert excels at low-G combat. Usually born among the wealthy and raised playing low-G assisted sports, a PMS Expert is equally at home leading a charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. PMS Experts also learn how to defend VIPs, often serving as the protectors or bodyguards. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

### Born to Fly (replaces Born to the Saddle):

Starting at 3rd level, you have a custom jetpack, which gives you a fly speed of 30ft in environments with less than 1G.

Your mastery as a maneuverer becomes apparent. If you start Spiraling, you have advantage on saving throws to recover.

__All other class features remain the same.__
