## Fighter: Personal Maneuvering System Expert (Cavalier)

The archetypal PMS Expert excels at low-G combat. Usually raised playing expensive, low-G assisted sports, a PMS Expert is a natural team player. PMS Experts often learn how to defend VIPs,  serving as the protectors or bodyguards.

### Born to Fly (replaces Born to the Saddle):

Starting at 3rd level, you have a custom jetpack, which gives you a fly speed of 30ft in environments with less than 1G.

Your mastery as a maneuverer becomes apparent. If you start Spiraling, you can use half your flying movement to recover. While your Personal Maneuvering System has fuel, you are immune to the **free-floating** condition.

__All other class features remain the same.__
