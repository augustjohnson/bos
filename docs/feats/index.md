In addition, custom feats may be made, but need to be a re-skinning of an existing feat with a in-universe set of abilities well-thought out and explained. 

Example 1, Artificer Initiate, with re-skinned cantrip and 1st level spell.

Example 2, Eldritch Adept, with a subset of possible invocations based on a rare and always-worn full-face mask and certain abilities given by that mask. (Misty Visions, Mask of Many Faces, Devil's Sight, Beguiling Influence need no changes to be functional.)

Example 3, Svirfneblin Magic, with a few adjustments to the spells being cast.
