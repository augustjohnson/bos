In addition, custom feats may be made, but need to be a re-skinning of an existing feat with a in-universe set of abilities well-thought out and explained. See the below examples as basic inspiration for reskinned feats.

**Magic Initiate**, with re-skinned cantrip and 1st level spell.

### Zap Kit (Magic Initiate - Wizard)
* Electrified Gloves (Shocking Grasp)
* Arc Lightning - (Witch Bolt)

**Eldritch Adept** with a set of re-skinned invocations.

### Technomask (Eldritch Adept)
 * Mask of Many Faces
 * Enhanced Optics - (Devil's Sight)
(You can switch to Misty Visions as some sort of holographic projection.)

Example 3, Svirfneblin Magic, with a few adjustments to the spells being cast.
