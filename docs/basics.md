### Skills

Skills are mostly the same as in a fantasy campaign in DND 5e with a few additions and subtractions.

**Strength** - Athletics

**Dexterity** - Acrobatics - Sleight of Hand - Stealth

**Intelligence** - Arcana - ~~History~~ - Investigation - Nature - ~~Religion~~ - Physics - Technology

Due to very little utility of an education in religion or nature, those two skills have been deprecated with the following direct replacements.  Any effects that applied to the former can now apply to the latter.
* **Nature** has been replaced by **Physics**, the ability for you to recall information about the dynamics of systems in our physical universe.
* **Religion** has been replaced by **Technology**, the ability to recall technical information related to equipment, ships, or computer systems.

**Wisdom** - Animal Handling - Insight - Medicine - Perception - Survival

**Charisma** - Deception - Intimidation - Performance - Persuasion

### Planes
In most cases, you can simply replace the word "plane of existence" with "planet".

For example, if you wanted to re-skin the spell Mind Spike, you would always know the location of the target for 1 hour as long as they remained on the same planet.

### Conditions
In addition to all conditions in DND 5e, there is one more, that only applies in 0 gravity environments.  It is *Spiraling*.  In some situations, something that might cause a creature to become prone, when taken in 0G environments will cause them to start *spiraling* instead, at DM's discretion.  For example an attacker succeeding in a shove would be unable to force a target prone in 0G, but they would be able to start a target spiraling.

#### Spiraling
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature moves 10 feet in a random direction (the bearing continues after their first turn), but otherwise cannot move.
* The creature can use an action to try and stabilize.
* A creature taking the stabilize action has to succeed a DC12 Dexterity saving throw to no longer be spiraling.
