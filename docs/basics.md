### Skills

Skills are mostly the same as in a fantasy campaign in DND 5e with a few additions and subtractions.

**Strength** - Athletics

**Dexterity** - Acrobatics - Sleight of Hand - Stealth

**Intelligence** - Arcana - ~~History~~ - Investigation - Nature - ~~Religion~~ - Physics - Technology

Due to very little utility of an education in religion or nature, those two skills have been deprecated with the following direct replacements.  Any effects that applied to the former can now apply to the latter.
* **Nature** has been replaced by **Physics**, the ability for you to recall information about the dynamics of systems in our physical universe.
* **Religion** has been replaced by **Technology**, the ability to recall technical information related to equipment, ships, or computer systems.

**Wisdom** - Animal Handling - Insight - Medicine - Perception - Survival

**Charisma** - Deception - Intimidation - Performance - Persuasion
