### Skills

Skills are mostly the same as in a fantasy campaign in DND 5e with a few additions and subtractions.

**Strength** - Athletics

**Dexterity** - Acrobatics - Sleight of Hand - Stealth

**Intelligence** - Arcana - ~~History~~ - Investigation - Nature - ~~Religion~~ - Physics - Technology

Due to very little utility of an education in religion or nature, those two skills have been deprecated with the following direct replacements.  Any effects that applied to the **former** can now apply to the **latter**.
* **Nature** has been replaced by **Physics**, the ability for you to recall information about the dynamics of systems in our physical universe.
* **Religion** has been replaced by **Technology**, the ability to recall technical information related to equipment, ships, or computer systems.

**Wisdom** - Animal Handling - Insight - Medicine - Perception - Survival

**Charisma** - Deception - Intimidation - Performance - Persuasion

### Planes
In most cases, you can simply replace the word "plane of existence" with "planet".

For example, if you wanted to re-skin the spell Mind Spike, you would always know the location of the target for 1 hour as long as they remained on the same planet.

### Conditions
In addition to all conditions in DND 5e, there is one more, that only applies in 0 gravity environments.  It is ***Spiraling***.  In some situations, something that might cause a creature to become prone, when taken in 0G environments will cause them to start ***spiraling*** instead, at DM's discretion.  For example an attacker succeeding in a shove would be unable to force a target prone in 0G, but they would be able to start a target spiraling.

#### Spiraling
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature moves 15 feet away from whatever caused the condition (the bearing continues after their first turn), but otherwise cannot move.
* The creature can use an action to try and **stabilize**.
* A creature taking the **stabilize** action has to succeed a DC12 Dexterity saving throw to no longer be spiraling.

### The Worlds
See each of the world's pages for details, but the following things are commonplace:
* Many humans have brain implants to get information to and from their brain.  A cell-phone for their brain.
* A few humans have cybernetic body parts, or body modifications.
* Humans that are born in environments that are less than 1g are nearly always recognizable on sight because of their lanky dimensions and underdevelopment muscles compared to earthborn.
* Various environments with lower artificial gravity have been created.
