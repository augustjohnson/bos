# Basic Rule Changes

### Skills

Skills are mostly the same as in a fantasy campaign in DND 5e with a few additions and subtractions.

**Strength** - Athletics

**Dexterity** - Acrobatics - Sleight of Hand - Stealth

**Intelligence** - Arcana - History - Investigation - ~~Nature~~ - ~~Religion~~ - *Physics* - *Technology*

Due to very little utility of an education in religion or nature, those two skills have been deprecated with the following direct replacements.  Any effects that applied to the **former** can now apply to the **latter**.
* **Nature** has been replaced by **Physics**, the ability for you to recall information about the dynamics of systems in our physical universe.
* **Religion** has been replaced by **Technology**, the ability to recall technical information related to equipment, ships, or computer systems.

**Wisdom** - Animal Handling - Insight - Medicine - Perception - Survival

**Charisma** - Deception - Intimidation - Performance - Persuasion

### Conditions
In addition to all conditions in DND 5e, there are two more that only apply in 0 gravity environments.  They are ***Free-Floating*** and ***Spiraling***.  For example an attacker succeeding in a shove would be unable to force a target prone in 0G, but they would be able to start a target spiraling.

### Free-Floating
* A creature that is free-floating is prone.
* The creature moves 15 feet per round away from whatever caused the condition (the bearing continues after their first turn).

#### Spiraling
* A creature that is spiraling is restrained.
* The creature moves 15 feet per round away from whatever caused the condition (the bearing continues after their first turn).
* The creature can use an action to try and **stabilize**.
* A creature taking the **stabilize** action has to succeed a DC12 Dexterity saving throw, and then they are free-floating instead of spiraling.

### Planes
If you are adapting a spell or ability, in most cases, you can simply replace "plane of existence" with "planet".

For example, if you wanted to re-skin the spell Mind Spike, you would always know the location of the target for 1 hour as long as they remained on the same planet.

### Languages
All humans can communicate verbally using Common.  There are also a set of hand signals, similar to American Sign Language, but modified for conditions in the vacuum of space called Void Signals.  It is purely somatic.
