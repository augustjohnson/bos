# The Unbroken Company
The Unbroken Company is a defunct company of mostly hobgoblins available as mercenaries.  They had a good record (although perhaps not quite *unbroken*) before the occupation of Osgan, and the [Sixdays War](../history/the_sixdays_war.md), in which they were completely disbanded.  Members of the company remained in occupied Hatham, and it remains occupied, completely run by the Hobgoblins.  They call themselves the Last Company.
